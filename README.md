# Hello-World
My first real Repository

I don't remember how I used to use Ruby, and this is not why I'm here. I want to learn something new, a better random number generator that does more than just mocks the user for liking numbers that are not 11! honestly it has been years, maybe I will learn to love coding again. puts "Hi, who are you?" gets=a if a=.s puts "Hello [a]!" else puts "no numbers please"

That's as far as I can remember, this should be fun!
